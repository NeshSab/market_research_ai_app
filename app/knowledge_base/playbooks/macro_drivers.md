# The Three Forces: Rates, Inflation, Growth

**Interest Rates** — price of money set by central banks and markets.  
- **Rising:** costlier borrowing → slows growth; usually **USD↑**.  
- **Falling:** cheaper borrowing → stimulates growth; usually **USD↓**.

**Inflation** — broad price increases.  
- **Rising:** central banks likely hike → tighter liquidity → **USD↑**.  
- **Falling:** room to cut or pause → looser liquidity → **USD↓**.

**Growth (GDP)** — economic expansion.  
- **Strong:** revenues/earnings tailwind → equities favored.  
- **Weak:** profits compress → defensives and bonds favored.

**Mental Model:**  
_When growth slows → cuts → USD weakens → stocks/commodities often rise._  
_When growth overheats → hikes → USD strengthens → risk assets cool._

# The Currency Engine (USD)

**USD strengthens when:**
- US yields > foreign yields (wider differentials).
- Risk-off flows seek safety/liquidity.
- Global growth weakens relative to the US.

**USD weakens when:**
- Global growth broadens (risk-on, capital abroad).
- The Fed cuts or adds liquidity (QE).
- Inflation/rates rise faster elsewhere than in the US.

**Rule of thumb:** capital chases **real yields** (nominal – inflation).

# How Markets React (typical tendencies, not guarantees)

- **U.S. Stocks:** USD↑ can pressure multinationals’ foreign earnings; USD↓ can help exporters.
- **Emerging Markets:** USD↑ is a headwind (USD debt, funding costs); USD↓ tends to help.
- **Commodities (oil, gold):** often **USD inverse** in USD terms (USD↑ → commodities↓).
- **Bonds:** risk-off USD↑ episodes often see yields↓ (bond prices↑); risk-on USD↓ the reverse.
- ** USD in Risk-On Regimes:** Classic risk-on: USD tends to weaken as capital rotates to riskier/foreign assets;
commodities often rise. U.S. exceptionalism risk-on: USD can strengthen with U.S. equities if U.S. growth/real yields outpace peers. Use equities (S&P 500 ↑) and VIX ↓ to distinguish risk appetite; then interpret USD accordingly.

*Chart cue:* DXY vs **^GSPC** vs **GC=F** (normalized) often shows the inverse dance.

# Central Banks & Liquidity

- **Hikes / QT:** tighter liquidity → USD↑ bias → risk assets cool; value/defensives can hold up.
- **Cuts / QE:** looser liquidity → USD↓ bias → cyclicals/growth/commodities can lead.

**Key point:** central banks set **incentives**; markets transmit via credit conditions and FX.

# Sector Rotation Cheatsheet (Regime → Sectors)

- **High Inflation, High Growth (HI/HG):** Energy, Materials, Industrials  
  *Why:* strong demand + pricing power; commodities tailwind.

- **High Inflation, Low Growth (HI/LG):** Utilities, Healthcare, Staples  
  *Why:* defensives with steady cash flows; lower sensitivity to cycles.

- **Low Inflation, High Growth (LI/HG):** Technology, Consumer Discretionary  
  *Why:* longer-duration cash flows favored when rates/discount rates are benign.

- **Low Inflation, Low Growth (LI/LG):** Dividend Aristocrats, REITs  
  *Why:* income stability/real-asset ballast when growth is scarce.

> Confirmation tools: 5–10d relative strength vs SPY + sector ETF; breadth; volume vs 20d avg; yield curve changes.

# Pitfalls & Confirmations

**Pitfalls:**
- Short-lived USD spikes on **risk shocks** (geopolitics, liquidity squeezes) can reverse quickly.
- Oil supply shocks can lift both USD **and** energy equities (breaks simple inverse logic).
- Earnings/guidance can override macro in the near term.

**Confirm with:**
- Move size & persistence (e.g., yields ±50 bps in 2 weeks).
- Cross-asset alignment (USD, commodities, yields agreeing).
- Volume and breadth (is leadership broad or narrow?).

# Mini Glossary

- **DXY:** U.S. Dollar Index vs basket of majors.  
- **VIX:** implied S&P 500 volatility (“fear gauge”).  
- **Yield Curve:** spread between long and short maturities (e.g., 10Y–2Y).  
- **Real Yield:** nominal yield minus inflation.  
- **QE/QT:** central bank balance-sheet expansion/contraction.

# Prompt Hints (retrieval for LLM)

- “Explain today’s sector moves using the USD/rates framework above; cite cross-asset confirmations.”  
- “When USD rises and yields fall on risk-off, which sectors typically resist best and why?”  
- “Given LI/HG conditions, justify Tech/Discretionary leadership with 2 cause-effect links.”
