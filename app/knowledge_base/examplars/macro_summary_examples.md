# Macro Summary Exemplars

High-quality examples of macro recaps. Each includes context inputs + final target summary.

---

## Example 1 — 2025-02-14 — CPI Upside Surprise
**Context:**  
• CPI came in hotter than expected.  
• Real yields rose; USD firmed.  
• Equities softened; curve bear-flattened.

**Summary:**  
The hotter CPI print kept pressure on real yields and supported the USD, leading to a broad risk-off tone. Equities traded lower as markets reassessed the timing of Fed cuts, while the curve bear-flattened. Core inflation remains sticky, reinforcing a “higher-for-longer” bias.

---

## Example 2 — 2025-03-18 — CPI Cooler, Growth Steady
**Context:**  
• CPI cooled modestly.  
• Yields fell; financial conditions eased.  
• Growth data steady, no recession signals.

**Summary:**  
A softer CPI print allowed yields to drift lower and eased financial conditions, supporting risk appetite. With growth metrics holding steady, markets rotated back into cyclicals. The USD softened modestly as rate differentials narrowed. The backdrop aligns with disinflationary expansion.

## Example 3 — 2025-04-26 — Payrolls Miss Expectations
**Context:**  
• Payrolls came in below consensus.  
• Yields dropped sharply; curve steepened.  
• USD weakened; defensives outperformed.

**Summary:**  
A weaker payrolls report revived expectations for earlier Fed cuts, sending yields lower and steepening the curve. The USD weakened alongside the shift in rate differentials, and defensives led equity performance. Markets are starting to price a late-cycle moderation but not a recession.

---

## Example 4 — 2025-06-12 — FOMC Hawkish Hold
**Context:**  
• Fed kept rates unchanged but raised dot plot.  
• Yields rose; USD strengthened.  
• Equities mixed; growth under pressure.

**Summary:**  
The Fed’s hawkish hold pushed yields higher and strengthened the USD as markets re-priced the policy path. Growth-heavy sectors lagged, while value and defensives provided some ballast. Financial conditions tightened slightly, consistent with a mid-cycle cooldown.

---

## Example 5 — 2025-07-04 — Global PMIs Improve
**Context:**  
• PMIs beat across US/EU/Asia.  
• Commodity prices firmed; cyclicals up.  
• USD mixed; curve steepened modestly.

**Summary:**  
Global PMIs surprised to the upside, supporting the view that manufacturing is bottoming. Cyclicals outperformed and commodities gained on improved demand expectations. Yields inched higher with a mild steepening bias. Markets lean toward an early-cycle reflation narrative.

---

## Example 6 — 2025-08-20 — Risk-Off Liquidity Shock
**Context:**  
• Funding spreads widened abruptly.  
• USD spiked; yields fell sharply.  
• Equities sold off; volatility up.

**Summary:**  
A sudden tightening in funding markets sparked a risk-off move, sending the USD sharply higher and pulling yields lower. Equities sold off across regions while volatility jumped. The episode reflects liquidity stress rather than a shift in fundamentals, but bears monitoring.

---

## Example 7 — 2025-09-14 — Commodity Rally on Supply Constraints
**Context:**  
• Oil and industrial metals surged.  
• Inflation expectations up; breakevens widened.  
• Energy and materials rallied.

**Summary:**  
Commodity strength driven by supply constraints lifted inflation expectations and supported cyclical sectors. Yields rose with breakevens, while real yields were stable. The USD saw mixed performance as commodity currencies outperformed. Markets are rotating toward inflation-sensitive exposures.

---

## Example 8 — 2025-10-22 — Broad Risk-On Rebound
**Context:**  
• Softer Fed commentary.  
• Financial conditions eased; yields stable.  
• USD drifted lower; global equities rallied.

**Summary:**  
Markets staged a broad risk-on rebound as softer Fed communication eased fears of overtightening. The USD weakened modestly, supporting commodities and global equities. Yields held in a narrow range, and leadership skewed toward growth and cyclicals typical of improving risk sentiment.
