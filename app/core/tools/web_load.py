"""
Web content loading tool for article and document retrieval.

This module provides functionality to load complete content from specific
URLs, complementing web search capabilities by retrieving full article
text and document content. It uses LangChain's WebBaseLoader to extract
clean, structured content from web pages.

The tool is designed for scenarios where specific URLs need content
extraction, such as following up on search results or loading referenced
articles for comprehensive analysis.

Key features:
- Full article content extraction
- Clean text parsing from web pages
- Error handling and logging
- Integration with LangChain document loaders
- Structured content output for analysis
